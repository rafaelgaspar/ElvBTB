ElvUI Better Totem Bar
======================

The idea is to develop a Totem Bar replacement for ElvUI inspired by FloTotemBar.

It is still in a very early development stage, and a stable version will probably not see the light of the day in Azeroth before Mists of Pandaria release.

Long-term Road Map
------------------

* Version 0.1.0 - First usable version - Estimated release: Very soon
* Version 1.0.0 - First stable version - Estimated release: Around Mists of Pandaria release
* Version 2.0.0 - Remove ElvUI as required dependency - Estimated release: Soonâ„¢
